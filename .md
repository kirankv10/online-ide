## Steps to setup BUILDROOT in ubuntu

1. Open a terminal and Create a directory for buildroot. (For future refs this will be called as Terminal 1) <br>
**mkdir -p Documents/buildRootForAML**<br>
2. mkdir -p Documents/buildRootForAML <br>
**mkdir -p Documents/buildRootForAML/v1-4**<br>
**cd Documents/buildRootForAML/v1-4**<br>
3. Run the following command to clone and Checkout to the version we are using currently using the command. <br>
**git clone https://gitlab.com/buildroot.org/buildroot.git**<br>
**git checkout 2024.02.3**<br>

4. Download the configuration files from the [**Buildroot-AML-Config**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tWTTJNEhBHYvw1Ja8QsKRgkX3xX7nGSV)
5. Open the downloaded dir in a terminal window and run the following command.(For future reference this will be referenced as Terminal 2)<br>
**cp -r main-Config/.config**<br>
**$HOME/Documents/buildRootForAML/v1-4/**<br>
6. Now run the following command in Terminal 1 <br>
**git clone** **https://github.com/Probots-Electronics/Probots_Internal-FoS-AML-Overlays.git**<br>
7. Now run the below command in Terminal 1 <br>
**make menuconfig**

![file3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56f92bec-069a-43d9-890d-dcc0b33ebab0) <br>

Press Enter and edit this to **Probots_Internal-FoS-AML-Overlays** then exit and save this configuration <br>

![file4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3bed51c6-3cd5-44dd-bb2b-c3b7e3a7637e) <br>

9. Now run make in Terminal 1 and wait for it to get finished <br>
10. Once this is finished, go back to Terminal 2 and run the following command <br>
**cp -r busbox-config/.config** <br>
**$HOME/Documents/buildRootForAML/v1-4/output/build/busybox-1.36.1/** <br>
11. Now go back to Terminal 1 and run the command make busybox-**menuconfig** <br>
In this GoTo Networking Utilities and Check if nc is included or not, if not include it. <br>
A * to the left of the package means it‚Äôs included. Make sure you save the configuration during exit. <br>

![file6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c540d411-9398-4ccf-86b7-fea2967bf48a) <br>
12. Now run **make** in Terminal 1. And wait for it to get finished.<br>
As soon as this build is done, you have generated your own rootfs partition for AML-CB.<br>
The generated file is  ***xx/Documents/buildRootForAML/v1-4/output/images/rootfs.cpio.uboot*** <br>
13. To run this in an AML CB, first rename this file to uramdisk.image.gz<br>
Then transfer this file to /foundry/probotsOS/ and reboot the CB from the terminal.<br>
> [!NOTE]
> only applicable if you‚Äôre using FoundryUpdate Tool V-12-30-26-11 to do initial installation.
13. If you want to install a new AML board, download the dtbs and other files from the link below <br>
**[SupportFiles](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Uz2QXdKi9X6FCJREAfOugYeyMLWdWmSJ)** 
 Replace the uramdisk.image.gz in this with the one you have built. <br>
 Open this directory in terminal and run this command to get unlock.tar.gz **tar -cvzf unlock.tar.gz** * <br>
14. Now to get the tool, download the [file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nnR_2BUWf-GU1hfGMF3EcE3KUgOLIYi5/view). <br>
Extract the files from this zip, replace the unlock.tar.gz in this directory with the one you got in the previous step.<br>
For better analysis and understanding it would be better if you run the tool in the terminal using the command **./ProFDUnlockTool-General-linux.** <br>

> [!Warning]
* Make sure to give necessary permissions to the files that you have created or modified.
* Do not mess with initd scripts until and unless you know what you are doing. <br>
* This will cause the CB to hang, not get IPs and many such things, if you are not careful. 
* Do not power off or shake the CB when you are doing SD Card flash, this will definitely ruin the board.
* If you are just transferring uramdisk.image.gz to an AML CB that‚Äôs already running Probots-OS, compulsorily reboot the CB from the terminal and do not power cycle the board.
* When you are running make command make sure your current working directory is 
**xx/Documents/buildRootForAML/v1-4.** <br>
* If you try running **make** from any other internal dirs you‚Äôll have to run **make** **clean** and re-run the entire **make**.
* If you have to delete any existing files in the rootfs, you‚Äôll have to run make clean and then run make again. <br>
* Every time you run make clean you‚Äôll have to repeat the process from Step 5.
* Before transferring unlock.tar.gz make sure only these files are present in it.<br>
***[ devicetree.dtb, env.script ,fw_env.tar.gz ,uramdisk.image.gz ,vmlinux.bin]*** <br>
No extra files or duplicate files should be present.
